# Attribution

Attribution is required for most content that I used in this project.
To facilitate a place to find all resources used, this file has been created. Some content might be referenced directly, others might have been used in a more general sense.
This is a good place to write out what part or idea has been used and where to find it.

I am not aware of a standard and do not claim to set a standard. I hope all parties are setisvised with the way I set here.
